# 🚀 Super Awesome Lox Tokenizer 🚀

Hey there, code ninjas! 👋 Welcome to the coolest tokenizer this side of the internet! 

## What's this thing do? 🤔

This bad boy takes your Lox code and chops it up into tiny, digestible pieces called tokens. It's like a blender for your code, but way cooler and less likely to wake up your roommates.

## Features 🌟

- Tokenizes numbers (even those pesky decimal points)
- Recognizes strings (because who doesn't love a good "Hello, World!")
- Identifies all the fancy Lox keywords
- Handles operators like a boss
- Deals with identifiers (aka the names you give your variables when you're too tired to be creative)

## How to use this beast 🦁

1. Clone this repo (you know the drill)
2. Run it like this: `./your_program.sh tokenize your_lox_file.lox`
3. Watch in awe as it spits out tokens faster than you can say "syntax error"

## Known issues 🐛

- Might occasionally tokenize your coffee order. We're working on it.
- Not compatible with actual lox (the food). Please don't try to tokenize your bagel.

## Contributing 🤝
